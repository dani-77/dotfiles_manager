# dotfiles_manager

My simple approach to manage dotfiles; nothing fancy, just a script to backup and install dotfiles.

## Dependencies

 . bash

 . dialog

## User instructions

run the script using:

```
sh dotfiles
```

Backup your current dotfiles using the backup option and create a repository (example: notabug.org or github.com); If like for me, your dotfiles have sensitive info, I advise you to create the repo in private mode.

Copy the backed up files to your git repo and from now on you have your dotfiles ready to be deplyed using the script install option.

Enjoy!
