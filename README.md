# dotfiles_manager

My simple approach to manage dotfiles; nothing fancy, just a script to backup and install dotfiles.

## Dependencies

 . bash

 . dialog

## User instructions

Run the script.

```
sh dotfiles
```

Backup your current dotfiles using the backup option and create a repository, for example at notabug.org or github.com; 
If, like mine, your dotfiles have sensitive/private info, I advise you to create the repo in private mode.

Copy the backed up files to your git repo and from now on you have your dotfiles ready to be deployed using the script install option.

Enjoy!
